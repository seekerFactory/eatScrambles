Collection of (ML, Statistical study, ...) scripts as I get to know them and add them :o)
Will surely mention how I got to know one. Respect-Refference.

Scripts will mostly be independent from each other and might be in different languages. Will not try to congruate but will group them in classes.  

Each script will have small dataset and test case included inside as example set.
Scripts can provide method for data structuring inside itself, if req, hence knowing whats eatable(requirement) and how to prepare it.
