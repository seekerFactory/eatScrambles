Collection of (MachineLearning, Statistical and Probablistic Data Processing,...) study scripts as I get to know them 8-) 
Will surely mention how I got to know each one (Respect-Refference).

Scripts will mostly be independent from each other and might be in different languages. Will not try to congruate but will group them by usages.  

Each script group will have small example dataset and test cases for example run.
Scripts can provide method for data structuring inside itself, if req, hence knowing whats eatable(requirement) and how to prepare it.


OOps was just about to forget!! will also provide where best to get the installation requirements, if any.
